# Movie search (Failed interview ~~test~~, volume 3)

I applied for a position at a company I was dying to work for. This time around, I ___did___ manage to pass the technical assessment, with some good parts and some bad parts, of course. In the end, I didn't pass the penultimate interview. So, so close.

## Requirements
The task was to build a simple movie search engine that would fetch the results from the Open Movie Database, and show the results.
* Mobile-first approach.
* ~~There has to be a top bar, where the search box will be located.~~ I'm going to ditch this :)

## Constraints
It was not allowed to use any framework to make the request (Axios or similar). UI frameworks were allowed but highly discouraged.
