# Movie search (Failed interview ~~test~~, part 3)

This time around, I __did__ manage to pass the technical assessment, with some good parts and some bad parts, of course. The task was to build a simple movie search engine that would fetch the results from the Open Movie Database, and show the results.

## Requirements
* Mobile-first approach.
* ~~There has to be a top bar, where the search box will be located.~~ Decided to ditch this for this version of the project.

## Constraints
It was not allowed to use any framework to make the request (Axios or similar). UI frameworks were allowed but highly discouraged.
