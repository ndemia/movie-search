![picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndemia/demia.me/main/assets/images/interview03.png)

I applied for a position at a company I was dying to work for. This time around, I ___did___ manage to pass the technical assessment, with some good parts and some bad parts, of course. In the end, I didn't pass the penultimate interview, my lack of experience showed. So, so close :(

## Task
Build a simple movie search engine that would fetch the results from the Open Movie Database, and show the results.

## Requirements
* Mobile-first approach.
* Each result should have its own card (or among those lines, can't remember exactly as it was long ago and I haven't kept the documentation).
* ~~There has to be a top bar, where the search box will be located.~~ I'm going to ditch this :)

## Constraints
* It was not allowed to use any framework to make the request (Axios or similar). UI frameworks were allowed but highly discouraged.
